## The Challenge

The project involved creating an e-learning platform for the Digital Creators Community. A crucial aspect of the project was the full automation of the course sales process.

Additionally, one of the project requirements was the ability for self-management of the courses – adding new ones and modifying their content. The solution turned out to be building a service based on Next.js, Payload CMS, and Stripe.

## My Role

- **Project coordination and subcontractor management** – I was responsible for supervising the graphic designer's work, providing detailed feedback, ensuring visual consistency and platform usability.

- **Frontend implementation in Next.js & TypeScript** – Based on the prepared design, I coded the entire frontend using Next.js.

- **Payload CMS integration** – I integrated Payload CMS with Next.js to enable content updates.

- **Stripe payment automation** – I integrated Stripe so that users would automatically receive access to the purchased course after payment.

- **Implementation of e-learning platform features** – I ensured the implementation of features such as course progress tracking and knowledge tests that grant a certificate upon completion.

- **Infrastructure management** – Everything was hosted in the AWS cloud, and data was stored in MongoDB. This made the platform secure, scalable, and fast, which is particularly important for online courses.

## Technology

- **Next.js & TypeScript** – Using Next.js with TypeScript enabled quick frontend deployment and ensured performance.

- **Payload CMS** – I used the Headless CMS methodology to allow full content control while improving performance.

- **Stripe** – Stripe integration automated all payment processes and allowed for quick implementation of a subscription or one-time purchase model.

- **AWS** – The application was hosted on AWS, which guaranteed scalability and security.

- **MongoDB** – Data was stored in MongoDB.

## What I Learned

- **Advanced payment integration** – The project allowed me to deepen my knowledge of Stripe – from handling one-time payments to automatically granting course access.

- **Project management and team coordination** – Working with an external designer required clear communication and feedback delivery, which translated into efficient execution of subsequent project stages.
