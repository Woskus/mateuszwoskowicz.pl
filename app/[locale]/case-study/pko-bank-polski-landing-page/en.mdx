## The Challenge

The goal of the project for PKO Bank Polski was to create a website aimed at young Fortnite players. This required a modern, dynamic design while maintaining high security standards — after all, PKO Bank Polski is the largest bank in Poland.

At the same time, full accessibility had to be ensured so that every user could access the website.

Another key requirement was enabling flexible content changes via a CMS, allowing the site to be updated at any time.

## My Role

In this project, I led the work comprehensively, going beyond just writing code:

- **Design preparation** – Together with a subcontractor, I prepared two initial design proposals: one closely aligned with the client’s brand style, and the other being our original creative interpretation. Ultimately, the client chose our concept, which we further developed.

- **Subcontractor coordination** – I oversaw the team responsible for design and cybersecurity. I regularly provided feedback, ensured timely delivery, and monitored task execution.

- **Implementation** – I coded the website according to the Figma design, using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

- **CMS integration** – Using Sanity.io, I enabled content editing, giving the PKO Bank Polski team full control over website content and allowing them to toggle the site on or off at any time.

- **Security** – We implemented special cloud-based solutions on AWS. By using Server Components in Next.js, CMS data processing occurred on the server side. As a result, users received pre-rendered HTML, which significantly improved security.

- **Accessibility focus** – I placed special emphasis on ensuring the site met full accessibility standards.

- **Client communication** – I conducted consultations and training sessions with the PKO Bank Polski team so they could fully leverage the implemented solutions.

## Technology

- **Next.js & TypeScript** – Used Server Components for better performance and security.
- **Tailwind CSS** – Enabled faster website styling, which was helpful given the short project timeline.
- **Sanity.io** – The CMS that allows the PKO Bank Polski team to freely update content or take the site offline.
- **AWS** – Provided a high level of security, scalability, and uptime.

## What I Learned

- **Advanced practical security** – Working for PKO Bank Polski deepened my understanding of implementing security measures and cloud-based solutions.

- **Comprehensive project coordination** – Collaborating with subcontractors and the client helped me develop my team management and project communication skills.

- **Improved accessibility handling** – The project required meticulous application of accessibility guidelines, which enhanced my knowledge in this area.

- **CMS integration with Next.js** – I learned how Sanity.io works and how to implement it securely into a Next.js project.
