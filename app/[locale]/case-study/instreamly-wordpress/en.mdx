## The Challenge

As part of inStreamly’s rebranding, I was tasked with building a new website while retaining the existing backend on WordPress.

Since WordPress already hosted several dozen posts, switching to an entirely new CMS would have been too time-consuming and costly.

The solution turned out to be applying the Headless CMS methodology: WordPress provided data via API and GraphQL, while Next.js took over the frontend role, rendering individual pages with content fetched from the API.

## My Role

- **End-to-end implementation** – I was responsible for fully migrating the site from WordPress to Next.js, including CMS integration, design implementation, and project management.

- **Project management** – In addition to development, I managed the project by organizing tasks, coordinating the team, and ensuring timely delivery of each component. Despite very tight deadlines, the entire implementation was completed within just a month, which was quite a challenge given the complexity of the website.

- **Design implementation** – The design included many custom elements, which posed challenges in terms of responsiveness and performance.

- **SEO optimization** – It was essential to maintain or even improve the site’s search engine rankings. In Next.js, I implemented solutions that allowed for generating meta tags and a sitemap similarly to WordPress, while improving page load times.

## Technology

- **Next.js & TypeScript** – I used Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG), which translated into better performance and improved SEO.
- **WordPress** – Served as the backend, providing data through GraphQL and API.
- **GraphQL** – Enabled data fetching from WordPress and smooth integration with the frontend.

## What I Learned

- **Implementing Headless CMS** – Integrating WordPress with Next.js required combining several technologies, significantly expanding my knowledge and skills in headless architecture.

- **Working with custom design** – Balancing an impressive visual design with high performance was key in this project.

- **Maintaining and improving SEO** – Migrating from WordPress to Next.js posed SEO challenges but ultimately improved search rankings.

- **Project management under tight deadlines** – Effective planning, team communication, and task prioritization were critical to launching such an extensive site in an exceptionally short time.
